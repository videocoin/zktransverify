# Pepper Project #
## Third party software ##

This repository contains the releases of various third-party software
that the [Pepper system](https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper) requires.

Note that in some cases newer versions of these packages are available
elsewhere. For the most part those newer versions should work. The versions
we distribute here are the ones we use in our experiments, and should be
used when replicating our published numbers.
