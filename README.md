# VideoCoin Proof-of-Transcode using zkSNARKs
This repo contains software modules that implements VideoCoin proof-of-transcode based on zkSNARKs.

zkSNARKs(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), being integrated in Ethereum byzantium, is a very powerful tool for verification of computations. The the correctness of computations can be verified without having to execute them and verifier will not even learn what was executed.

Existing zkSNARK systems like zCash use it as the transaction verifier. On Ethereum, zkSNARKs would not be limited to a single computational problem, but instead, it could be customized for specialized computational problem. Core support for zkSNARKS in Ethereum is enabled through precompiled contracts EIP196 and EIP197 that provide elliptic curve operations for addition,scaling and pairing check. Refer[4],[5] for details of the Ehtereum precompiled contracts.  

VideoCoin can use the zkSNARKs for proof-of-transcode by using a video quality metric called SSIM(Structural Similarity Index). zkSNARKs facilitates to move compute intensive proof calculations off-chain and light-weight on-chain verification in a smart-contract. Even though the initial implementation of proof-system include basic algorithm, it can be hardened to resist any security attacks. Refer [7] for detailed description of zkSNARks and for a lighter reading refer to the blog post [12] 

zkSNARKs uses Elliptic curve pairing for homomorphic hiding / encoding / encryption. Elliptic curve pairings are a recent addition to cryptography and fuelling advancements in the blockchain technologies. There are several blockchain applications of elliptic curve pairings that include Identity Based Encryption, Non-interactive Zero Knowledge proofs, Short Signatures etc. Refer [1],[2],[3] for detailed description of Elliptic Curve Pairing. In addition to elliptic curve pairing, a stage in the zk-SNARKS involves translation of computations into polynomials called a Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP). Computations are first converted to an Arithmetic circuit. An arithmetic circuit consists of gates computing arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication, with wires connecting the gates.

The following diagram shows an overview of video-coin proof-of-transcode using zkSNARKS. We use  SSIM generated by the proof system from a macroblock at random offsets in the committed transcoded stream.    

![Blockdiagram showing VideoCoin Proof-of-transcode verification](./documents/zkproofoftranscode.png)

The proof-of-transcode includes the following modules:
### (A) Library for Setting up Transcode proof system
* Computation (algorithm) that performs the following
** Extracts MBs at random offsets
** Decode MBs
** Calculate SSIM
** Compare with reference SSIM
* Generation of keys
** Generation of Proving Key
** Generation of Verification Key
** Solidity Contract template

### (B) Library for proof generation:
* Extraction of witness (public and private inputs) which consists macroblocks from source and transcoded streams.
* Proof generation using the witness and proving-key


### C) An Ethereum smart contract that performs the following:
*  Maintains escrow records for video segment transcode requests. Each escrow record contains the precomputed challenge supplied by the client library along with mining reward amount,\
* Smart-contract also contains the zkSNARKS verification keys and algorithm embedded (which uses Ethereum precompiled contracts)\
* The call from the miner(prover) assembles the input&witness from the supplied arguments and retrieving the encrypted hash values from the escrow records corresponding to the segment. If the verification is successful, it transfers the reward to miner's account.

## Performance and scalability of proof-of-transcode
The zero-knowledge feature of zkSNARKS property allows the prover to hide details about the computation from the verifier in the process, and so they are useful for both privacy and performance. This enables a embedding verifier in a smart-contract and offload most of the computation to prover. As the smart-contract runs on all the blockchain nodes and prover runs only on one client, this helps achieve scalability.

### Key generation, proof and verification
zkSnarks includes three steps:
* A one-time setup phase where required Computation is transformed to zkSnarks proover key and verification key through several internal steps that include Algebraic circuit generation, R1CS and QAP. It also includes generation of random values that are used in generation of the keys and discarded (anyone accessing these random values, if not properly discarded, can create attacks).
* Proof generation that uses proving key generated in the previous phase, public input and private secret that prover knows as part of performing computation. This proof is sent to the verifier.
* Verification processes uses verification key, proof and public input and performs verification based Elliptic Curve homo-morphing.

### Details of Elliptic Curve Pairing Computations used in Video Transcode Verification

![Blockdiagram showing zkSnarks Mains Steps](./documents/zkproof_3.png)

The zkSnarks proof is expected to satisfy a compliance predicate: 
```
C(input, code, output)

input  - input bitstream and transcode options 
output - output bit stream
code   - decode and encode opertation conforming to required transcode options
```
Incase of Transcode Verification, "input" is source bitstream and transcode options, "output" is transcoded bit stream and "code" is transcode operation. The representation of the above compliance predicate requires huge computation power on the part of prover. There are  attempts such as in ref[21] to apply it for image transformation.

The current implementation of Transcode Verification uses a simplified proof generation where input consists of few macroblocks randomly selected in the from the source and transcoded streams.


![Blockdiagram showing zkSnarks Proof derived from Encode Process](./documents/zkproof_4.png)

### Tight association of proof generation with encode process 
The proposed enhancement includes a proof generation based on bitstream syntax elements such as macroblocks and video quality metrics such as SSIM. We will also include pHash as an additional check, but may be dropped if we can support enough macroblocks in the proof system. The proof system is described in the following sections in more detail. Public input containing macroblocks/positions  and expected SSIM are submitted by the client. The macroblocks are selected at the near end of the video segment and signaled through the smart contract.   This ensures prior frames are encoded correctly. The number of macroblocks used in the proof should create hurdle to generate fake proofs. The SSIM generated in the proof system is compared against  the client supplied SSIM to fall with in a range. This ensures the transcode operation is carried with the specified transcode parameters. 

## TinyRAM for transcode computation
As miner may generate fake proofs for verification based on source stream, we have to consider transcode operation as a part of verification process. To avoid fake proof generation.

## Macro-block decode based verification
### Outline of the proof generation and verification using SSIM Macro-blocks

#### Public Inputs

This section describes the public Inputs for the proof and verification:

![Public Inputs for the proof/verification](./documents/proof_inputs.png)

* Input Stream Hash: Wallet registers a digest(hash of the input stream segment) with the smart contract along with the trancode request.
* Output Stream Hash: The miner generates a digest(hash of the transcoded stream) to be used in the proof. A storage miner can generate the digest on the received segment and update to the smart contract.

A random macroblock for verification is selected based on a hash generated from hashes of input and output streams. Offset of the frame containing the macroblock and offset of the slice/macroblock in the frame is obtained from the hash value.

* Input Macroblock Hash: Miner will generate and inlcude hash of the input macroblock. It also stores the digest with the smart contract. 
* Output Macroblock Hash: Miner will generate and inlcude hash of the output macroblock. It also stores the digest with the smart contract.
* Compression Ratio: Used for generating expected SSIM

![Overview of proof/verification](./documents/proof_verification.png)

#### Operations at Miner:
* A. Validate the input stream using the digest stored by the wallet in the smart contrct
* B. Perform the transcode operation
* C. Sent the stream to the storage.
* D. Generate digest for output stream
* E. Generate proof. The proof includeds following constraint system
* E.1 Generation of hash from hashes of input stream and output stream hashes 
* E.2 Selection of input and output macrobocks based on hash in E.1
* E.3 Decode Macroblocks
* E.4 Generate SSIM
* E.5 Compare against threshold generated based on public input "compression ratio"

#### Verification:
* A. Validate for public inputs: Input stream hash is supplied by Wallet. Output stream hash is supplied by Miner (and optionally retrieved by Verifier, See Note-1 below)
* B. Hasahes for input and output macroblocks are supplied by the Miner (and optionally retrieved by Verifier. , See Note-1 below ) 
* C. Generate Elliptic Curve Pairing points using proof and public inputs and check for pairing using Ethereum precompiled contracts

Note-1: Automated(Smart Contract based) dispute resolution:
Using hashes of input and output macrobocks in the proof allows automated resolution if there is a dispute between Wallet/Storage and Miner.


### TinyRAM 
TinyRAM [23] is used to support general computations written in high level languages. So, we can apply macro-block decoding as timyRAM program to get computational proofs.
To achieve this we have to go though few steps:
* Macro-block decoding algorithm should be converted into tinyRAM assembly code. 
* Assembly code should be generated into small circuits that checks correct execution.
* After feeds those circuits into zkSNARK to generate the proofs.

On of the key challenges right now to find the way to generate tinyRAM assembly code from hight level C program due to lack of tinyRAM compiler.
Alternative way to implement circuits for macro-block decoding is to use pepper project [24].

### SSIM calculation using Pepper [24]
Core implementation of SSIM was taken from https://github.com/mirror/x264/blob/master/common/pixel.c#L688 and adapted for Pepper compiler https://github.com/VideoCoin/zktransverify/blob/pepper/src/pequin/pepper/apps/x264_ssim_16x16.c.
Three separate SSIM calculation were implemented for frame sizes 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 respectively (Pepper doesn't support dynamic parameters this is the reason to have three SSIM calculations).

Algorithm works with frames in YUV format. Luma component (Y) is used for SSIM calculation.

| Frame | Input Variables | Proving key size | Verification key size | Proving time (Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz, 4vCPU 12GB RAM) | Proving time (Intel Xeon 2.2 GHz, v8CPU 16GB RAM) |
|-------|:---------------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| 16x16 |             512 |            57 MB |                121 kB |                         2.6691 s |           2.3168 s |
| 32x32 |            2048 |         277.4 MB |                180 kB |                        11.6607 s |         11.3058 s |
| 64x64 |            8192 |           1.3 GB |                420 kB |                       58.8939s s |    52.7337 s                      |           

Verification time for all cases ~5 ms.


## Status
The current implementation is only tested in a simulated environment. The zkSNARKs proof libraries needs to be split and integrated with the transcode miner and VideoCoin client libraries.
